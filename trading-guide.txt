📘 Comprehensive Trading Guide: Liquidity, Market Structure & Options
🔹 Core Market Concepts
Swing Highs & Lows
Swing High = a local peak (candle higher than those before/after). Stops often sit above.
Swing Low = a local trough (candle lower than those before/after). Stops often sit below.
These are key areas of external liquidity (clusters of stop orders).

Liquidity
Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL): above swing highs.
Stops from shorts (buy-stops).
Breakout traders buying above highs.
Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL): below swing lows.
Stops from longs (sell-stops).
Breakout traders selling below lows.
External Liquidity: obvious highs/lows.
Internal Liquidity: inefficiencies inside the move → Fair Value Gaps (FVGs).
Targeting after sweeps:
If BSL is taken, market often reverses down → target FVG first (internal liquidity), then opposite SSL (external).
If SSL is taken, market often reverses up → target FVG first, then opposite BSL.

Why Markets Move
Hunt liquidity (stop runs).
Rebalance insufficiencies (fix fast, inefficient moves).
Return to equilibrium (midpoint, VWAP, consolidation).
Generate liquidity (new highs/lows attract future orders).

Displacement
Energetic break: strong, impulsive move clearing liquidity with momentum.
Leaves FVGs (imbalances) that price may retrace into before continuation.
Manipulation (weak sweep): price wicks through a level but doesn’t follow through → often reverses.

Sweep
When price briefly pushes above a swing high or below a swing low to take out stop-loss orders.
It “sweeps” the liquidity sitting at that level (stop orders, breakout entries).
Often followed by a reversal in the opposite direction.

🔹 Market Structure
Market Structure Shift (MSS)
Change from lower highs/lows → higher highs (bullish), or vice versa.
Confirmed by displacement + FVG.
Anytime a low is manipulated (weak break, no displacement) → reversal setup → target the previous high that failed to push lower.
Key point:
A valid “new high” forms when displacement + FVG confirm.
If a high fails to create a lower low → the high itself becomes a future target.

🔹 Market Maker Models (MMM)
Price moves from FVGs (internal) to swing points (external).
Goal: Catch moves by aligning higher timeframe (HTF) liquidity zones with lower timeframe (LTF) entries.
Checklist for MMM:
Spot HTF FVG (daily/4H).
Drop to LTF (15m/5m).
Look for multiple consolidations → stop runs under them.
Once price enters HTF FVG, wait for manipulation → displacement → new LTF FVG.
Enter at LTF FVG, stop under manipulation low, target HTF swing point.
Extra trick:
Once HTF FVG is tapped, new lows in bullish context = likely manipulations → can re-enter or trail stops tighter.

🔹 Market Phases (Power of 3)
Accumulation / Consolidation → sideways build-up.
Stop Run (fakeout) → liquidity grab above/below range.
Reversal / Displacement → strong move in true direction.

🔹 Entry Models
Rule: No Key Level Tap = No Trade
Always require sweep + displacement before entering.
1. iFVG (Inverted FVG Model)
HTF key level tapped.
LTF shows FVG down into key level → reversal bullish.
Enter long, stop under low, target HTF swing.
Options: Buy Call / Bull Call Spread.
2. CISD (Change in State of Delivery)
Liquidity sweep → engulf → entry.
Example: down candles dominate, then market engulfs bullish.
Options: Buy Call / Bull Call Spread.
3. MSS + FVG Return
Market structure shift → retrace into imbalance (FVG).
Enter in displacement direction.
Options: Call/Puts, or spreads to reduce cost/IV crush risk.

🔹 Timeframe Alignment
HTF = find liquidity pools (swings, FVGs).
LTF = find entry trigger.
Alignments:
Weekly → 4H
Daily → 1H
4H → 15m
1H → 5m
15m → 1m
👉 For options intraday:
Use 4H to mark BSL/SSL for the day.
Use 15m/5m for execution triggers.

🔹 Stops & Targets
Stops:
Beyond liquidity grab wick (for shares).
Grab wick - candle wick left behind after a sweep; shows where price ran through a level, triggered stops, but then quickly rejects
For options: Use defined-risk spreads, or limit premium paid.
Targets:
Opposite liquidity pool.
Midpoint or VWAP for partial exits.
Swing point on HTF.

🔹 Options Basics (Applied to Liquidity)
Long (Bullish)
Buy Call = profit if price rises.
Bull Call Spread (Debit) = buy call (lower strike) + sell call (higher strike).
Cheaper than buying a naked call.
Max profit = strike difference – debit.
Best after SSL sweep + bullish displacement.
Short (Bearish)
Buy Put = profit if price falls.
Bear Put Spread (Debit) = buy put (higher strike) + sell put (lower strike).
Cheaper than buying a naked put.
Max profit = strike difference – debit.
Best after BSL sweep + bearish displacement.
Neutral + Premium Collection (Credit Spreads)
Bear Call Spread (Credit, bearish/neutral)
Sell lower call + buy higher call.
Profit if stock stays below short call strike.
Max profit = credit received. Max loss = strike difference – credit.
Bull Put Spread (Credit, bullish/neutral)
Sell higher put + buy lower put.
Profit if stock stays above short put strike.
Max profit = credit received. Max loss = strike difference – credit.
Option Type Obligations:
Buy Call (Long Call): If stock rises above strike price, you have the right to buy stock at the strike price → profit from stock rising.
Sell Call (Short Call): If stock rises above strike price, you are obligated to sell stock at the strike price → loss if stock rises too much, profit from collecting premium if it stays below.
Buy Put (Long Put): If stock falls below strike price, you have the right to sell stock at the strike price → profit from stock falling.
Sell Put (Short Put): If stock falls below strike price, you are obligated to buy stock at the strike price → loss if stock drops a lot, profit from collecting premium if it stays above.

👉 Rule of thumb:
0DTE–7DTE = stick to calls/puts (fast execution, directional).
Event trades / longer contracts (14DTE–45DTE) = use spreads for defined risk and less IV crush impact.
Debit spreads = directional bets with lower cost.
Credit spreads = neutral-to-directional bets, best when you expect price to stall.

🔹 Quick Trading Workflow
Mark Liquidity Pools on HTF (4H for day trading options).
Wait for Sweep (BSL or SSL).
Watch Reaction (wick rejection or displacement).
Entry:
BSL taken → Buy Put / Bear Put Spread.
SSL taken → Buy Call / Bull Call Spread.
Risk Management:
Stop beyond liquidity wick (or use defined spread).
Target opposite liquidity pool.
Partial exits at VWAP/midpoints.

✅ Bottom Line
Charts first, option chain second. Chart gives signal → chain gives vehicle.
Short-term options (0DTE–7DTE): Calls/puts = best. Spreads = slower, better for events/longer contracts.
BSL sweep → bearish bias. SSL sweep → bullish bias.
No liquidity tap = no trade.
Always think in terms of internal (FVG) vs external (swings) liquidity.
