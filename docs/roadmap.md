**Pending:**
- [ ] Use Tiingo or Alpaca for historical & IV data
- [ ] Compute Expected Move (1â€“7 DTE and 14â€“45 DTE) and IV Rank (IVR)
- [ ] `/api/v1/expected_move/{ticker}` and `/api/v1/volatility/{ticker}` endpoints
- [ ] Discord command: `/em` to query expected move and volatility snapshot
- [ ] Continue using GitHub Actions for periodic refreshes (no in-process scheduler)

**Key Features:**
- IV regime-based strategy selection
- Expected move validation for strike positioning
- Real-time option chain data from Schwab
- Capital-efficient recommendations for small accounts (<$25k)

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 5 â€“ Refinement & Deployment Hardening
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Replace heavy pandas workflows with async + orjson
- [ ] Improve caching + batch endpoints
- [ ] Add watchlist management API (`GET/POST /api/v1/watchlist`)
- [ ] Optimize Docker builds and memory profile
- [ ] Optional migration of scheduler to Cloud Run (2 GiB free) if needed

**Memory Optimization:**
- Target: < 512 MB RAM for Render free tier
- Strategy: On-demand data refresh per command (no continuous scheduler)
- Fallback: GitHub Actions workflow for hourly watchlist refresh

---

## Version 2 â€“ Pro Features (Future)

**Note:** These features require dedicated infrastructure (>1 GiB RAM, dedicated scheduler) and will be implemented once V1 is stable and delivering useful insights.

### ðŸ§  Market Structure & Alerting

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Fair Value Gap (FVG) detection
- [ ] VWAP and range break monitoring
- [ ] Live streaming feed with Discord alerts
- [ ] Dedicated scheduler with >1 GiB RAM (Google Cloud Run or Fly.io)

**Requirements:**
- Real-time data processing
- Message queue system (Redis Streams or RabbitMQ)
- Background worker for continuous monitoring

### ðŸ’¬ Enhanced Bot Interactions
**Goal:** Advanced Discord commands for flow analysis and sentiment summaries

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `/flow-leaderboard` - Top flow activity across tickers
- [ ] `/sentiment-summary` - Multi-ticker sentiment overview

## Deployment Strategy

### Version 1 Architecture
**Infrastructure:** Render Free/Starter Tier ($0-$7/month)

**Services:**
- `volaris-api`: FastAPI app with health checks
- `volaris-bot`: Discord bot with slash commands
- External DB: Neon (PostgreSQL, free tier)
- External Cache: Upstash (Redis, free tier)

**Data Refresh Strategy:**
- On-demand: Commands trigger `/api/v1/market/refresh/{symbol}` for requested ticker only
- Scheduled: GitHub Actions workflow calls batch refresh endpoints hourly for watchlist (no in-process scheduler)
- Rationale: Avoids memory overhead of APScheduler (400-1000 MB)

**Memory Budget:**
- Target: < 512 MB per service
- Optimization: Async operations, orjson for JSON, no pandas in hot paths

### Version 2 Architecture
**Infrastructure:** Cloud Run or Fly.io ($20-50/month)

**Services:**
- `volaris-api`: FastAPI app (same as V1)
- `volaris-bot`: Discord bot (same as V1)
- `volaris-worker`: Dedicated background worker with APScheduler
- External DB: Neon or Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- External Cache: Upstash (Redis)
- Message Queue: Redis Streams or RabbitMQ

**Data Refresh Strategy:**
- Continuous: APScheduler jobs refresh price/options/IV every 15-60 minutes for monitored tickers
- Real-time: Streaming endpoints for live flow and structure alerts
- Memory: 1-2 GiB RAM allocated for worker process
