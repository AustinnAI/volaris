**Documentation:** See [docs/PHASE_2.md](docs/PHASE_2.md)

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 3 â€“ Options Flow Monitor
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Not Started

**Provider Strategy:**
- **Phase 3.0 (MVP - Week 1):** yfinance (primary) with custom anomaly detection
- **Phase 3.1 (Week 2-3):** Add Alpha Vantage as EOD validator
- **Phase 3.2 (Month 2):** Evaluate Unusual Whales free tier, upgrade if superior
- **V2 (Future):** Add Tradier for real-time data, Unusual Whales premium for alerts

**Phase 3.0 MVP - Custom Flow Detection (yfinance)**
- [ ] Create `FlowProvider` interface pattern (ABC)
- [ ] Implement `YFinanceFlowProvider` with custom anomaly logic
- [ ] Build anomaly detection: volume/OI ratio > 3.0, volume > 3Ã— avg, bid-ask < 10%
- [ ] Create `option_flow` database table for unusual activity storage
- [ ] Add `/api/v1/flow/{ticker}` endpoint (returns unusual contracts)
- [ ] Implement `FlowProviderManager` with yfinance-only fallback
- [ ] Add Discord `/flow` command to query unusual activity
- [ ] Focus: SPY, QQQ, + S&P 500 top 50 by market cap

**Phase 3.1 - Validation Layer (Alpha Vantage)**
- [ ] Implement `AlphaVantageFlowProvider`
- [ ] Add to fallback hierarchy: yfinance â†’ Alpha Vantage
- [ ] Daily comparison report (yfinance vs Alpha Vantage unusual flags)
- [ ] Rate limiting: 500 req/day = 1 check per ticker every 3 hours

**Phase 3.2 - Premium Upgrade Path (Unusual Whales)**
- [ ] Test Unusual Whales free tier (Shamu plan) for SPY/QQQ
- [ ] Compare custom anomaly logic vs Whales pre-built flags
- [ ] If Whales superior: implement `UnusualWhalesProvider` and upgrade to paid
- [ ] Add Discord webhook for instant unusual activity alerts (if paid plan)
- [ ] Keep yfinance as fallback if Whales API down

**Key Features:**
- Custom anomaly scoring (0-1) based on volume, OI, liquidity, premium
- Volume spike detection (vs. 30-day rolling average)
- Block trade identification (premium > $50k)
- Historical flow data storage for pattern analysis
- Discord alerts for significant flow events
- Provider abstraction for easy swapping/upgrading

**Technical Decisions:**
- **No Tradier in V1:** Requires OAuth flow, adds complexity without critical value for MVP
- **No Intrinio:** 2-week trial only, too expensive for indie project
- **No Polygon.io:** Free tier excludes options data
- **Memory Budget:** <100MB for yfinance pandas operations (within 512MB Render limit)

**Dependencies:**
- `yfinance` - Free Yahoo Finance API (will add in Phase 3.0)
- `pandas==2.2.3` - Already installed (Phase 2)
- `numpy==2.1.2` - Already installed (Phase 2)
- Alpha Vantage API key (free tier, 500 req/day) - will add in Phase 3.1

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 4 â€“ Trade Planning Tools (SPY/QQQ)
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Partial (Core complete, IV/EM pending)

**Completed:**
- [x] Vertical spread calculator (bull/bear, credit/debit)
- [x] Long options calculator (calls/puts)
- [x] Strike selection engine with IV regime detection
- [x] Strategy recommendation logic with bias context
- [x] DTE-based strategy weighting (0-7 DTE vs 14-45 DTE)
- [x] Position sizing by risk (% of account or fixed $)
- [x] Discord bot with 18 slash commands (`/plan`, `/calc`, `/size`, `/price`, `/iv`, etc.)

**Pending:**
- [ ] Use Tiingo or Alpaca for historical & IV data
- [ ] Compute Expected Move (1â€“7 DTE and 14â€“45 DTE) and IV Rank (IVR)
- [ ] `/api/v1/expected_move/{ticker}` and `/api/v1/volatility/{ticker}` endpoints
- [ ] Discord command: `/em` to query expected move and volatility snapshot
- [ ] Continue using GitHub Actions for periodic refreshes (no in-process scheduler)

**Key Features:**
- IV regime-based strategy selection
- Expected move validation for strike positioning
- Real-time option chain data from Schwab
- Capital-efficient recommendations for small accounts (<$25k)

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 5 â€“ Refinement & Deployment Hardening
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Replace heavy pandas workflows with async + orjson
- [ ] Improve caching + batch endpoints
- [ ] Add watchlist management API (`GET/POST /api/v1/watchlist`)
- [ ] Optimize Docker builds and memory profile
- [ ] Optional migration of scheduler to Cloud Run (2 GiB free) if needed

**Memory Optimization:**
- Target: < 512 MB RAM for Render free tier
- Strategy: On-demand data refresh per command (no continuous scheduler)
- Fallback: GitHub Actions workflow for hourly watchlist refresh

## Deployment Strategy

### Version 1 Architecture
**Infrastructure:** Render Free/Starter Tier ($0-$7/month)

**Services:**
- `volaris-api`: FastAPI app with health checks
- `volaris-bot`: Discord bot with slash commands
- External DB: Neon (PostgreSQL, free tier)
- External Cache: Upstash (Redis, free tier)

**Data Refresh Strategy:**
- On-demand: Commands trigger `/api/v1/market/refresh/{symbol}` for requested ticker only
- Scheduled: GitHub Actions workflow calls batch refresh endpoints hourly for watchlist (no in-process scheduler)
- Rationale: Avoids memory overhead of APScheduler (400-1000 MB)

**Memory Budget:**
- Target: < 512 MB per service
- Optimization: Async operations, orjson for JSON, no pandas in hot paths

### Version 2 Architecture
**Infrastructure:** Cloud Run or Fly.io ($20-50/month)

**Services:**
- `volaris-api`: FastAPI app (same as V1)
- `volaris-bot`: Discord bot (same as V1)
- `volaris-worker`: Dedicated background worker with APScheduler
- External DB: Neon or Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- External Cache: Upstash (Redis)
- Message Queue: Redis Streams or RabbitMQ

**Data Refresh Strategy:**
- Continuous: APScheduler jobs refresh price/options/IV every 15-60 minutes for monitored tickers
- Real-time: Streaming endpoints for live flow and structure alerts
- Memory: 1-2 GiB RAM allocated for worker process
